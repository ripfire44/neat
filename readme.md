# NEAT Template

This is a template for a NodeJS-Express-AngularJS-TingoDB (NEAT) stack based website.

Similar to MEAN stack based website, this template uses Tingodb. TingoDB is an embedded Javascript based DB that is a drop-in replacement to MongoDB. This is useful for development purposes where TingoDB can be easily replaced by MongoDB for production environment.

# NEAT Template

This is a template for a NodeJS-Express-AngularJS-TingoDB (NEAT) stack based website.

This is mostly similar to MEAN stack based website with the exception of using Tingodb. TingoDB is an embedded Javascript based DB that is a drop-in replacement to MongoDB. This is useful for development purposes where TingoDB can be easily replaced by MongoDB for production environment.
